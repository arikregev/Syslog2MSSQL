# Syslog2MSSQL
----
A small App I wrote a few years ago, while learning Java Basics towords my BSC in CS.</br>

The App gives a solution that allows syslogs (low rate) that is sent from a few systems</br>
to be logged into a MSSQL Database.

I was asked to write it because there was a limitation of using an existing MSSQL server.
